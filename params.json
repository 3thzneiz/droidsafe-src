The core of our system is a sound static analysis that can prove important properties of sensitive program behaviors before the programs appear in an application marketplace. Our system greatly improves the guarantees, efficiency, and effectiveness of malware diagnosis.\r\n\r\n### Publications ###\r\n\r\n * [Information Flow Analysis of Android Applications in DroidSafe](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mgordon/papers/droidsafe-ndss-2015.pdf). Michael I. Gordon, Deokhwan Kim, Jeff Perkins, Limei Gilham, Nguyen Nguyen, and Martin Rinard. NDSS 2015, San Diego, CA, February, 2015.\r\n\r\n### Application Benchmarks\r\n\r\nThe DroidSafe team contributed 40 micro-applications to the [DroidBench](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench) Android Information Flow benchmark suite.  The malicious Android applications from APAC cannot be release at this time due to our contract with DARPA.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@mgordon is the DroidSafe project leader at MIT.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\ndroidsafe@lists.csail.mit.edu","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
