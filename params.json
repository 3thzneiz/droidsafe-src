The core of our system is a static taint analysis and information flow analysis that operates on either Java bytecode for an application or an application's apk.  \r\n\r\nThe DroidSafe system includes:\r\n\r\n1. Comprehensive, accurate, and precise Android runtime semantics model\r\n\r\n1. A comprehensive set of sensitive source method calls defined on the Android API version 4.4.1.\r\n\r\n1. A comprehensive set of sink method calls that can exfiltrate information beyond application boundaries defined on Android API version 4.4.1\r\n\r\n1. Scalable and precise global static analysis optimized for the information flow problem on Android.  This includes a deeply object sensitive global points to analysis with a custom solver, and a global call-site sensitive, object sensitive, field sensitive, and flow-insensitive taint analysis.\r\n\r\n1. A plugin for the [Eclipse IDE](https://eclipse.org/) designed to help a trusted human analyst rapidly triage an unknown Android application.  The plugin, called the DroidSafe Navigator, presents our information flow analysis and points to analysis results overlaid on the source code for an application.  The DroidSafe Navigator also includes features to guide an analyst to sensitive portions of an application based on API usage and implementation idioms.\r\n\r\n### Publications ###\r\n\r\n * [Information Flow Analysis of Android Applications in DroidSafe](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mgordon/papers/droidsafe-ndss-2015.pdf).

The malicious Android applications from APAC cannot be release at this time due to our contract with DARPA.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@mgordon is the DroidSafe project leader at MIT.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\ndroidsafe@lists.csail.mit.edu","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
